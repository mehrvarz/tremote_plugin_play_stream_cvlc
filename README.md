# TRemote plugin play_stream_cvlc

TRemote is a service for ARM based Linux computers. It lets you remote control *things* on these kind of machines, specifically over Bluetooth. There is no limit to what you can remote control. You can access a list of predefined actions, you can execute executables and shell scripts, you can issue http request, and you can invoke your own or 3rd party native code plugins.

This repository contains the complete Go source code for a remote control plugin. You can use this plugin as-is. You can also use it as a template to implement extended functionality.

TRemote plugin play_stream_cvlc implements an internet radio player.
This is useful sample code, demonstrating how things can be implemented in the 
context of a TRemote plugin. It is also a very useful standalone internet 
radio streamer, that is reliable and fun to use.
