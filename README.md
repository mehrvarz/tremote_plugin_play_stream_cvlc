# TRemote plugin play_stream_cvlc - Internet radio streamer

TRemote is a service for ARM based Linux computers. It lets you remote control *things* on these kind of machines, specifically over Bluetooth. There is no limit to what you can remote control. You can access a list of predefined actions, you can execute executables and shell scripts, you can issue http request, and you can invoke your own or 3rd party native code plugins.

This repository contains the complete Go source code of a remote control plugin application. You can use this plugin as-is. You can also use it as a template to implement similar or extended functionality.

TRemote plugin **play_stream_cvlc** implements an internet radio streamer.
This is useful sample code, demonstrating how things can be implemented in the 
context of a TRemote plugin. This is also a very useful standalone internet 
radio streamer. It is reliable and fun to use.
